# Fraudulent Activities

## Project Description

### Goal

E-commerce sites transfer a lot of money. This can lead to significant risks of fraudulent activities, such as the use of stolen credit cards, money laundering, etc.</br>

Fortunately, Machine Learning can help us identify these fraudulent activities. All of the websites where you enter your payment information have a team that manages the risk of fraud through ML.</br>

The goal of this challenge is to build a model that allows you to predict the probability of a fraudulent transaction.</br>

### Description

Company X does E-commerce and sells handmade clothing. Your goal is to build a model that can predict whether buying a piece of clothing should be considered a fraudulent transaction or not.</br>

Here's exactly what you need to do:

1. For each user, determine the country of origin from their IP address

2. Build a model that can predict whether the activity is fraudulent or not. Also explain your choices / assumptions in terms of optimizing false positives and false negatives

3. Your boss would like to understand your model because he is worried about using a _black box_ model. How would you explain it from a user point, not mathematical. For example, which users can be classified as _risked_?

4. Suppose you can use your model live to make its prediction in real time. From a Product perspective, how would you use it? How could you think of the user experience with this product?
